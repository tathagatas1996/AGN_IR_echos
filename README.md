Simple model of reverberation from a distant parsec scale dust structure, with the following simplifications:
1) Observer is present only along the line of sight.
2) Only single scattering taken into account
3) detailed radiative transfer absent
   
In a nutshell, based on light-travel time due to the dust-structure + single scattering at a given position.
Improved version will include a ray tracing scheme.
